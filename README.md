<p align="center"><strong>An open source uptime and infrastructure monitoring application</strong></p>

![dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/252d6047-522b-4576-8f14-233510e464b8)

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend of Checkmate, an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations. Checkmate regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insights about your servers' CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature status.

Checkmate has been stress-tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

We **love** what we are building here, and we continuously learn a few things about Reactjs, Nodejs, MongoDB, and Docker while building Checkmate.

## üì¶ Demo

You can see the latest build of [Checkmate](https://checkmate-demo.bluewavelabs.ca/) in action. The username is uptimedemo@demo.com and the password is Demouser1! (just a note that we update the demo server from time to time, so if it doesn't work for you, please ping us on the Discussions channel).

## üîó User's guide

Usage instructions can be found [here](https://docs.checkmate.so/). It's still WIP and some of the information there might be outdated as we continuously add features weekly. Rest assured, we are doing our best! :)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

See installation instructions in [Checkmate documentation portal](https://docs.checkmate.so/quickstart). Alternatively, you can also use [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) or [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/checkmate) for a one-click Docker deployment. If you would like to monitor your server infrastructure, you'll need [Capture agent](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture). Capture repository also contains the installation instructions.

## üöÄ Performance

Thanks to extensive optimizations, Checkmate operates with an exceptionally small memory footprint, requiring minimal memory and CPU resources. Here‚Äôs the memory usage of a Node.js instance running on a server that monitors 323 servers every minute:

You can see the memory footprint of MongoDB and Redis on the same server (398Mb and 15Mb) for the same amount of servers:
