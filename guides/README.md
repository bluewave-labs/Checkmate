# Welcome to Uptime Manager

BlueWave Uptime Manager is an open-source server monitoring application used to track the operational status and performance of servers and websites.&#x20;

It regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time.
